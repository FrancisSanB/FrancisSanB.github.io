i see a lot of interpretations of this movie as "the fish are gay" hiding their true selves in order to be accepted. What was interesting is I saw this as a movie about immigrants in a foreign country or non-white people in a white country. Especially since the sea monsters live on the border of another land that has terrorized them (similar to colonialism in the northern Africa and southern Europe border) and as a result they are both scared of each other. They also spend a lot of the film learning the culture of the "surface world" including the handshake which Alberto instructs Luca to learn in school. Even the idea of eating pasta is foreign to them so they have their own style of eating food.
The themes of friendship and family are also very important in this film. I saw the vespa as a symbol of Luca and Alberto's initial understanding of friendship as being alone together (the vespa can only hold two). But what they learned throughout the movie is that they can be open and receptive to other relationships like the school and fishing symbolizing a larger community where everyone has a place.
But I think what makes this film so awesome is that it is ambiguous enough that it's about learning how to feel accepted in a foreign environment. Or at least to know how "to find the good ones." Understanding the thought-provoking themes of your own story and how to present them in an interesting, accessible way is Pixar's greatest strength. If there was any doubt that Pixar fell off, I think this film should eliminate them.
